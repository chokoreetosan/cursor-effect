# cursor-effect
A WebGL effect, using WebGL shaders, that creates a liquid cursor effect. Check the other branches to see variations of textures that can be piped into the graphics pipeline

If you want to test this cursor out 

1. Clone the repo

```
npm install
```
I would reccomend parcel as a simple webserver to test this code locally.
https://parceljs.org/

To test out the different branches

```
git checkout <branch>
```
You may need to refresh the page in browser, depending on what server you use.

Enjoy
